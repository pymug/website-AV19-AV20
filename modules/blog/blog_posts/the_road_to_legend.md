Why Another Python Markdown

What another Python Markdown implementation?
There is already a Python markdown implementation. So why write another one?

I've run into some issues with markdown.py, some of which looked like fixing might be quite difficult. My initial attempts to email the maintainer ended up bouncing. At that point I started looking into a re-write. I later noticed that markdown.py is hosted on GitHub. (TODO: create issues there and link to them here.)

TODO: mention the safe_mode thing and recent HTML sanitization discussions

For fun. Who doesn't like writing parsing code. :)
